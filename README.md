# Jelly Protocol

A smart contract framework for token rewards.

## JellyDrop - Airdrops
Jelly Airdrops use Merkle Proofs for whitelists at scale. Projects can launch their own token Airdrops using the Jelly 
Available with Airdrip for token vesting and Fancy Claim, the new safe way to claim.

## JellyPool - Farming
Farming is more fun with NFTs. Our farm will launch with Staking NFTs, representing the staked LPs and access to claim the rewards earned. 
Our farms support whitelists, multiple tokens and an updateable rewarder.
