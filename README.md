# Jelly Protocol

A smart contract framework for token rewards.

## Jelly Contracts
The Jelly protocol is split into seperate templates, pools, access controls, lists, tokens and descriptors. These modular templates are combined together into Jelly recipes, with the first permissionless recipe being the JellyDropRecipe.

## JellyDrop - Airdrops
Jelly Airdrops use Merkle Proofs for whitelists at scale. Projects can launch their own token Airdrops using Jelly.
Available with Airdrip for token vesting and Fancy Claim, the new safe way to claim.

## JellyPool - Farming (JELLY/USDC as first example before Recipe is created)
The first version of the Jelly Farm launched in May 2022 with Staking NFTs representing the staked LPs, a whitelisted pool, upgradeable rewarder and support for multiple rewards tokens. The JellyPool contract will form the basis of the Farming Recipe, and like the Airdrop Recipe can be used to create your own farm out of the box.
